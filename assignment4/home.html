                             <p>
      Susan is the matriarch of The Susan and Moe team.  She is a multiple award winning real estate professional like no other in Ottawa, and a member of the prestigious RE/MAX Hall of Fame (2015).  <br>

Living in Kanata, she is a wife, mother and former member of the Canadian Forces. After serving in the military for over a decade and developing a successful sales and marketing career, Susan then took a leap to explore a new career opportunity in Ottawa real estate. <br>

Her impeccable attention to detail and quick thinking made the transition to real estate come naturally. She uses her experience and intuition to anticipate and solve complex problems ensuring win-win outcomes even in difficult transactions.  <br>

Perhaps what sets Susan apart from other realtors in Ottawa is her dedication to her clients. Susan‚Äôs very protective of her client‚Äôs best interests and treats everyone like they were her first born!  <br>

Susan understands the needs of her clients and has witnessed her relationships grow over the years. She‚Äôs been there when a client purchased their first condo in Westboro, and when their first child was born. <br>
 She‚Äôs brought chicken noodle soup to a sick client and has taken the pressure out of the selling process during difficult times like separation and divorce. <br>
    Susan has witnessed all that is good and bad about life and real estate in Ottawa.  <br>
    She understands that a home purchase or sale is one of the biggest moments in a person‚Äôs life that needs to be taken care of with tact and care. <br>

She can out-market 99% of the agents in Ottawa because her brain never stops until your house is sold! Her in-depth knowledge of Ottawa and its neighbourhoods is an excellent resource for her clients in finding their perfect property. <br>

She is continually commended by clients and colleagues alike for her drive for success, marketing ingenuity, and unwavering work ethic. <br>

Continuously engaged in giving back to the community, she is heavily involved organizing the annual Zombie Run for Humanity event she founded, in support of Habitat for Humanity Greater Ottawa.  Her involvement with the community has also been featured in the Distinctive Women Magazine for four consecutive years, and as Philanthropist of the Year (2015 and 2016).</p>

	<blockquote>‚ÄúI could not ask for a better experience. The entire team is warm and professional: their stager gave me a lot of homework to do, but all worthwhile; the videographer/photographer team did a first-class job; and Susan, Moe and Lana and everyone else are not only professional, but just as important to me, they are genuinely nice people. Their work generated an absolute flurry of showings ending with 14 offers after just four days. I‚Äôm thrilled, and they earned every penny of their commission. I am very glad I didn‚Äôt try to sell the place on my own!‚Äú</blockquote>

	<blockquote>‚ÄúGreat service. The Susan and Moe team helped us even before we were ready for our formal search, gave us the advice needed to sell our home in a day, and helped us get into one much better suited for our family. The team worked well together, and were supportive through every step of the process.‚Äù</blockquote>
